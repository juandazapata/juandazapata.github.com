Hi, I'm Juanda and I'm a programmer born and raised in Colombia.

I've been programming since I was 12 and all I had was a x286 PC with 128MB of
HDD and 16MB of RAM. I've also been involved in the world of startups and I even
[sold one](http://www.studentuniverse.com/blog/2013/11/studentuniverse-acquires-travel-startup-wehostels/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}
in late 2013.

During my time as co-founder at **WeHostels**, I created and scaled a RESTful
JSON API that is currently used by many thousands of users every day to book
accommodation around the world.

I love Ruby on Rails and founded the
[Bogotá Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/bogota-ruby-meetup/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}
before leaving to New York City for 6 months. It was a great opportunity to meet
talented people in my beloved Colombia.

As any other serious programmer, I'm motivated by solving hard problems and I
find particularly interesting the scalability and architectural problems;
however above all, what I value the most is to work on things that solve real
problems for real people.

I have a [github profile](https://github.com/juandazapata){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"},
a [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/juanzuluaga){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}
and sometimes write in my blog.

I'm also a
[freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/en/users/445026/feed){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}
enthusiast and also created the
[Freeletics Bogotá Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1544842239085626/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}.

If you want to get in touch, drop me an email to **hello[at]juanda.me**.

I live in Medellín, Colombia and I'm currently available for hire as a remote
worker.
