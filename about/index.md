# Hola, soy Juanda!

Hi, I'm Juanda and I'm a programmer born and raised in Colombia.

I've been programming since I was 12 and all I had was a x286 PC with 128MB of HDD and 16MB of RAM.
Lately I've been involved in the world of startups and I even
<a href='http://www.studentuniverse.com/blog/2013/11/studentuniverse-acquires-travel-startup-wehostels/'
target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>sold one</a> in late 2013.

During my time as co-founder at <a href='https://wehostels.com' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>WeHostels</a>,
I created and scaled a RESTful JSON API that is currently used by many thousands of users every day
to book accommodation around the world.

I love Ruby on Rails and founded the
<a href='http://www.meetup.com/bogota-ruby-meetup/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Bogotá Ruby Meetup</a>
before leaving to New York City for 6 months. It was a great opportunity to meet talented
people in my beloved Colombia.

As any other serious programmer, I'm motivated by solving hard problems and I find particularly
interesting the scalability and architectural problems; however above all, what I value the most
is to work on things that solve real problems for real people.

I have a
<a href='https://github.com/juandazapata' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Github profile</a>,
a <a href='https://twitter.com/juanzuluaga' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Twitter profile</a>
and sometimes write in [my blog](http://juanda.me).

I'm also a
<a href='https://www.freeletics.com/en/users/445026/feed' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Freeletics</a>
enthusiast and also created the
<a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1544842239085626/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Freeletics Bogotá Facebook Group</a>.

I also have a couple of side projects:

<ul>
  <li><a href='http://whipnik.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Whipnik</a>, your next car without the hassle.</li>
  <li><a href='http://www.pintadiaria.com' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Pinta Diaria</a>, daily styles for men.</li>
</ul>

If you want to get in touch, drop me an email to **hello[at]juanda.me**.

I live in Bogotá, Colombia and I'm currently available for hire as a remote worker.
