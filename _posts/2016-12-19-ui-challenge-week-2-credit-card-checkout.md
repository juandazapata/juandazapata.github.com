This week I created a simple **Credit Card Checkout** screen.

For this challenge I imagined a checkout widget for a Daft Punk concert trying
to produce the minimum set of elements to complete the purchase action.

I also decided to release the Sketch source file.
[Download it](/images/daily-ui/02.credit-card-checkout.sketch) and use it in any
way you want.
