Last Nov 24th, I participated in the [Bogodev meetup](http://www.bogodev.org/ "Bogodev meetup") and 
gave a talk titled "**UI fundamentals for programmers**". My objective with this talk was to share 
my **personal** experiences with other developers and to have a nice and animated conversation 
around those experiences.

Since my talk was given in spanish, I'm going to share the key parts of it in this blog post.


### Disclaimer
I consider this field to be very subjective, because of that, the content of the speech is **VERY** 
biased by my personal experience. I'm very lucky to have 
a [brother](http://twitter.com/elrichardini "El Richardini") who happens to be an 
[awesome graphic designer](http://mishes.com), so a lot of this content is also based on his 
experiences too.


### Motivation


### UI is software


### We make software for people


### Mental models


### Least effective difference


### Fitt's law


### Design flows instead of screens


### Color psycology
This is 


### Tools for rapid prototyping
Twitter bootstrap, although lately I've been choosing Foundation over Bootstrap because I found it leaner and simpler.

Talk about Kuler, mention Sacha Greif book about color theory and also mention his blog post

### Kill WordArt!!!
Use flickr pictures (remember to include the copyright sentence and also make sure that the pictures have the correct license).

Put the links of presentation that don't suck (pt1 and pt2)

### Resources
Here are some resources that you might find useful:

- **[Don't make me think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)**: For some designers this is the holy grail of web usability. Highly recommended.
- **[ OS X Human Interface Guidelines ](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/Menus/Menus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000356-TP6)**: This is a beautiful gem if you are designing something intended
to be displayed on a laptop or a desktop computer.
- **[ iOS Human Interface Guidelines ](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html)**: Same as above but intended for mobile applications.
