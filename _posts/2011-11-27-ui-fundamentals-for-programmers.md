Last Nov 24th, I participated in the _Bogodev meetup_ and
gave a talk titled "**UI fundamentals for programmers**". My objective was to
share my **personal** experiences with other developers and to have
a conversation around those experiences. Since the talk was given in spanish,
I'm going to share the key parts in this post.


## Disclaimer
I consider myself a _noob_ in this field. The content of the talk is mostly
based on my personal experience. I'm very lucky to have
a [brother](http://twitter.com/elrichardini "El Richardini") who happens to be
a graphic designer, so a lot of this content is also based on his
experiences as well.

## Motivation
I sued a guy that owed me some money (long story), and then I heard
that our government just deployed an _fantastic tool_ to check the status
of the legal process... and then I found this **jewel**:

This made me sad. There are coders who apparently just don't give a single fuck
about their job.

I didn't use the web application. I just closed the browser tab.


## UI is software
Having worked for a long time developing applications for marketing
teams, I realized that for people with little to no experience in the
technical field, the **UI is the software itself**. They don't care if
there are database servers, Amazon instances or any other technological
component behind. For them, **the software is what they see and what
they can interact with**.

I think that the UI should be treated with the same (or more?)
respect as the rest of your software stack. **It's
the FIRST LAYER OF YOUR SOFTWARE**, give it some respect.


## We make software for people
We usually code things intended to be used by humans. A videogame, a corporate
website, a blog, even an API are examples of code that will be eventually
consumed by human beings, keep that in mind.


## Fitt's law
Here the idea is pretty simple: **"Do not put negative actions near to
positive actions"**. In english that'd be: **"Do not put the _delete post_
button, next to the _edit post_ button"**, that'll create stress in the user 
of your system, because the chances of making a mistake will be high.


## Color psycology
This is a very interesting and extensive topic. I didn't go into a lot
of detail here, but you should be aware of the basic concepts. Being
able to understand [why a "delete" button should be "red" instead of
"blue"](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+pshycology+for+web).


## Tools for rapid prototyping
This one is easy... currently there's no excuse for a programmer to
deploy sometning similar to the example that I mentioned earlier. 

When [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)  and
[Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) emerged,
everything changed. Those frameworks are easily customizable and give you a
decent starting point for your project.

## Resources
Here are some resources that you might find useful:

- **[Don't make me think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)**: An 
oldie, but for some UI designers this is the holy grail of web usability. Highly
recommended.
- **[ OS X Human Interface Guidelines ](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/Menus/Menus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000356-TP6)**: This is a beautiful gem if you are designing something intended
to be displayed on a laptop or a desktop computer.
- **[ iOS Human Interface Guidelines ](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html)**: Same as above but intended for mobile applications.
