Your users don't care about the underlying technologies that you use to build
your product.

They don't care about what programming language you used. They don't care if
your website is a _Single Page Application_ or you used _Turbolinks_. They don't
care if you have a _micro-services_ oriented architecture or if you created a
_monolith_. They don't care if your API is in _Rails_ or in _Go_.

All they care about is if **you solve a problem for them or not**. **And they
will pay you if your product is good enough**. That's all. Nobody really cares
if
[Slack uses PHP](https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329#.av6sp0omd)
or not, we just use it because it solves a problem.

However if you build the wrong product, it won't matter how many good technical
decisions you made along the road.
