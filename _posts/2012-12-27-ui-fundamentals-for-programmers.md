The last Nov 24th, I participated in the [Bogodev meetup](http://www.bogodev.org/ "Bogodev meetup") and gave a talk 
titled "**UI fundamentals for programmers**". My objective with this talk was to share my **personal**
experiences with other developers and have a nice and animated conversation around them.
